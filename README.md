# PIAPPROX

This is a small program visualizing how archimedes thought he could calculate pi, which involves inscribing shapes with a greater number of equal sidelengths and finding its perimeter, repeating until the desired precision is reached. It does work, but it converges on to pi exponentially slower as you increase the number of sides of the polygon you inscribe. The program tells you what the current approximation of pi is, how accurate it is, and the number of sides the current polygon is.
